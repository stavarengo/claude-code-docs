# Text generation

Claude excels in a wide range of text-based tasks. Claude has been trained to ingest code, prose, and other natural language inputs, and provide text outputs in response.

Prompts are best written as natural language queries as if you are instructing someone to do something, with the more detail the better. You can further improve your baseline prompt with [prompt engineering](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview).
