# SDK middleware

Intercept and modify requests and responses in the Anthropic SDKs.

---

The Anthropic SDKs provide a middleware (or interceptor) hook that lets you run code before a request is sent and after the response is received. Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, custom retries, request annotation, and refusal fallback handling.

    autonumber
    participant App as Your code
    participant M1 as Middleware A
    participant M2 as Middleware B
    participant Core as SDK core
    participant API as Claude API
    App->>M1: request
    M1->>M2: next(request)
    M2->>Core: next(request)
    Core->>API: HTTP request
    API-->>Core: HTTP response
    Core-->>M2: response
    M2-->>M1: response
    M1-->>App: response
```

Each middleware can inspect or replace the request before calling `next()`, and the response after `next()` returns.

## Registering middleware

Each middleware is a function that receives the outgoing request and a `next` callable. Call `next` to forward the request to the rest of the chain (or directly to the SDK core if this is the last middleware), and return its response. Anything before the `next` call runs on the way out; anything after runs on the way back.

## Middleware ordering

When you register multiple middleware, they apply in the order given: the first middleware's "before" code runs first, and its "after" code runs last. Middleware registered on the client runs before middleware passed as a per-request option.

In the Go SDK, repeated `option.WithMiddleware` calls concatenate (client first, then method). In the other SDKs, pass an array; later entries wrap inner.

## Replacing the HTTP client

Each SDK also accepts a custom HTTP client (for proxy configuration, custom TLS, or connection pooling). Only one HTTP client is used per SDK client; setting it replaces the default. The custom HTTP client receives requests after all middleware has run.

## Built-in middleware

The SDKs ship a refusal-fallback middleware that automatically retries requests Claude Fable 5 declines on a fallback model. See [Detect and retry on a fallback model](/docs/en/build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback#client-side-fallback) for setup and per-language examples.
