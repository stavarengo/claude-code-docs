description: "Manage the people in your Claude Enterprise organization with the Admin API: list members and change roles, send and withdraw invites, manage groups, and read custom roles."
---

This page covers managing the people in your **Claude Enterprise** (claude.ai) organization programmatically, using the [Admin API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/organization?sdk_languages=cli):

* List members and look them up by email address
* Change a member’s role
* Remove members, or sign them out everywhere without removing them (beta)
* Send and withdraw invites
* Manage your enterprise’s groups and their membership
* Read your organization’s custom roles

For Claude Console (Claude Platform) organizations, see the [Admin API guide for Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/admin-api?sdk_languages=cli).

## Which endpoints can your organization use?

The Admin API is a single set of endpoints under `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/`. Claude Console and Claude Enterprise organizations authenticate with different [Admin API keys](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/admin-api-keys?sdk_languages=cli) and each have access to a different subset of the endpoints:

Members and invites are the same endpoints for both organization types; this page documents their Claude Enterprise behavior, including the Claude Enterprise [organization roles](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#organization-roles). The group and custom-role endpoints exist only for Claude Enterprise.

<Check>
  **Scoped Admin API key required**

  These endpoints require an Admin API key with the scope that matches the request. Member and invite `GET` endpoints, and all custom-role endpoints, need `read:members` (there is no separate role scope). Member and invite `POST` and `DELETE` endpoints need `write:members`. Group `GET` endpoints need `read:rbac_groups`, and group `POST` and `DELETE` endpoints need `write:rbac_groups`. Assigning the `managed` role, or groups on an invite, requires `write:rbac_groups` in addition to `write:members`. A key carrying the `read:org_audit` scope (a read-only scope for security-audit integrations) can also call every `GET` endpoint on this page and the [Compliance API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/compliance-api?sdk_languages=cli) read endpoints. See [Create an Admin API key](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/admin-api-keys?sdk_languages=cli#create-a-key-for-a-claude-enterprise-organization) for where to create one and which scopes to select. Pass the key in the `x-api-key` header on every request, together with the [`anthropic-version`](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/versioning?sdk_languages=cli) header.

Custom roles and their group attachments are managed in [claude.ai organization settings](https://claude.ai/admin-settings); the API reads them but cannot change them.

## Quick start

Set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to your Admin API key. The examples on this page read the key from it. The SDK and the `ant` CLI send the `Authorization` and `anthropic-version` headers for you.

List the organization’s members, newest first:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant organization:users list --limit 20
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "data": [

## Key concepts

### Organization roles

Every member has exactly one organization role. Reads return the member’s role as one of five values:

| Role               | Meaning                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user`             | A standard member.                                                                        |
| `managed`          | A member whose permissions are granted through the custom roles attached to their groups. |
| `owner`            | An organization owner.                                                                    |
| `membership_admin` | A member who can manage the organization’s members.                                       |
| `primary_owner`    | The organization’s primary owner. There is exactly one.                                   |

The API can assign only the `user` and `managed` roles, on invite creation and on role updates. Assigning `managed` requires the `write:rbac_groups` scope in addition to `write:members`, because a managed member’s permissions come from the custom roles attached to their groups. The administrative roles (`owner`, `membership_admin`, and `primary_owner`) are assigned in claude.ai organization settings, and members holding them cannot be modified or removed through this API.

### Members and invites

A person becomes a member by accepting an invite (or through your organization’s single sign-on, where configured). Creating an invite sends an invitation email; the invite then reads as `pending` until the recipient accepts (`accepted`) or its server-assigned `expires_at` passes (`expired`). Only a `pending` invite can be withdrawn. To change a pending invitation’s email address or role, withdraw it and create a new one.

If your organization’s plan draws members from a finite pool of purchased seats, a pending invite consumes a seat. The create-invite endpoint does not take a seat or tier parameter: the seat is assigned automatically from the lowest tier that has availability. Creating an invite when no seat is free fails with a 400 error rather than purchasing a seat. Withdrawing the invite, letting it expire, or removing the member later returns the seat to the pool.

### Groups and roles

Groups connect members to custom roles (role-based access control, the `rbac` in the endpoint paths and scope names). Groups belong to your parent organization and every organization under it, not to a single organization. So the group scopes (`read:rbac_groups` and `write:rbac_groups`) require a key created for all linked organizations. Each group carries a `source_type`: `direct` for groups created in claude.ai, `scim` for groups provisioned by your identity provider. A group’s `role_ids` field lists the IDs of the custom roles attached to it. Resolve them to names and permissions with the [custom role endpoints](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#custom-roles). Each organization has its own role catalog, but groups are shared across your parent organization. So fetching a role that belongs to a different organization under your parent organization returns 404 for your key. The `role_ids` field is `null` (rather than `[]`) when role data was temporarily unavailable, so retry to distinguish a degraded read from a group with no roles.

## Versioning

Send the `anthropic-version` header on every request; see [Versions](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/versioning?sdk_languages=cli) for the available versions.

## Rate limits

Admin API endpoints share a per-organization limit of **100 requests per minute**; invite creation has its own limit of **1,200 requests per hour** instead. Requests over a limit return **429 Too Many Requests**.

## Pagination

Member and invite lists use ID-based pagination: pass `limit` (default 20, maximum 1,000) plus at most one of `before_id` or `after_id`, and page using the `first_id` and `last_id` fields of each response until `has_more` is `false`. Group and custom-role lists use an **opaque cursor** instead: pass the response’s `next_page` value unchanged as the `page` parameter on the next request, until `next_page` is `null`.

When you iterate over the results, the SDK fetches more pages for you, so `limit` sets the page size, not the total. In the CLI, `--limit` sets the total number of results for member and invite lists. For group and role lists, it sets the page size.

## Error responses

Error responses follow the standard shape documented in [Claude API errors](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/errors?sdk_languages=cli).

## Members

### List members

`GET /v1/organizations/users` returns the organization’s members, most recently added first. Filter by `email` to look up a specific member; the match is case-insensitive and tolerates common variants of the same address (for example, `jane+hiring@example.com` matches `jane@example.com`). Requires the `read:members` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [List users](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/organization/users/list?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant organization:users list --email jane@example.com
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Get a member

`GET /v1/organizations/users/{user_id}` returns one member by ID. Requires the `read:members` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Get user](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/organization/users/retrieve?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant organization:users retrieve --user-id user_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Change a member’s role

`POST /v1/organizations/users/{user_id}` sets the member’s role to `user` or `managed`. Members holding an administrative role (`owner`, `membership_admin`, or `primary_owner`) cannot be changed through this endpoint, and administrative roles cannot be assigned; both return 400 and are managed in claude.ai organization settings. If your organization’s identity provider manages roles (advanced SSO or advanced SCIM provisioning), role updates return 400. Requires the `write:members` scope, plus `write:rbac_groups` when changing the role to `managed`.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Update user](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/organization/users/update?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant organization:users update \
    --user-id user_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt \
    --role managed
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Remove a member

`DELETE /v1/organizations/users/{user_id}` removes the member from the organization, returning any purchased seat they occupied to the organization’s pool. Members holding an administrative role cannot be removed through this endpoint, and if your identity provider manages membership (SCIM), removals return 400. Requires the `write:members` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Remove user](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/organization/users/remove?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant organization:users remove --user-id user_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "type": "user_deleted",
  "id": "user_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt"
}
```

### Sign a member out everywhere

`POST /v1/organizations/users/{user_id}/sign_out` signs a member out of Claude on every browser and device, without removing them from the organization. Use it when a member’s device is lost or stolen, during a security incident, or while you investigate an account before you decide whether to remove the member. Requires the `write:members` scope.

<Note>
  This endpoint is in **beta** for Claude Enterprise organizations.

  Every request must include the [beta header](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta-headers?sdk_languages=cli) `anthropic-beta: admin-user-sign-out-2026-10-08`. A request without it returns 400, with a message that names the value. The SDK and the CLI send it for you.

  If your version of the SDK or the `ant` CLI doesn’t have this endpoint, send the request over HTTP with this header.
</Note>

The sign-out reaches the person’s whole Claude account, including their sessions in other organizations and on an individual plan. The member keeps their seat and role and can sign in again right away. To keep someone out, [remove them](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#remove-a-member) or, if your organization requires single sign-on, disable their account in your identity provider. Disabling stops new sign-ins but leaves them in your member list. If you remove someone and leave their identity provider account active, automatic provisioning can add them back at their next sign-in. If your identity provider manages membership, you can remove the member only there.

Create the key before you need it. See [Create a key for a Claude Enterprise organization](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/admin-api-keys?sdk_languages=cli#create-a-key-for-a-claude-enterprise-organization). A `write:members` key works only in the organization it was created in, so each linked organization needs its own key. That organization’s primary owner creates it. To look members up by email address with the same key, also select the `read:members` scope.

The request has no body. Pass the member’s `id`, which [List members](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#list-members) returns:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant beta:organization:users sign-out --user-id user_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt
  ```
</CodeGroup>

A successful request returns 200 with the member, whose role and other fields are unchanged:

```json
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "user_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "role": "user",
  "added_at": "2026-06-12T09:14:03Z"
}
```

If you have no key yet, an owner can use the **Sign out everywhere** action on the Members page of [claude.ai organization settings](https://claude.ai/admin-settings) instead. It ends the same sessions, trusted devices, and OAuth tokens, and removes the same push-notification registrations. An owner can’t use it on their own account: they sign out their own sessions from their account settings in claude.ai.

#### What the request ends

The request ends all of the following for the member:

* **Sign-in sessions:** All of them for the person’s account, on every browser and device.
* **Trusted devices:** Every browser, computer, or phone that the person registered as trusted for sensitive actions. The person must register each device again.
* **OAuth tokens issued for this organization:** Whichever app holds them, such as Claude Code or a third-party app. Those apps must sign in again. A token almost always stops working at once, and within an hour at most.

The request also clears the record of browsers on which the person chose to skip Claude’s two-step verification, so that the next sign-in there asks for the second step again. It also removes the push-notification registrations that Claude holds for the person’s phones, desktop apps, and browsers, so that Claude stops sending notifications to them. This removal runs asynchronously: it usually completes within a minute, but in rare cases can take longer. A 200 doesn’t confirm either of these two steps.

Only the OAuth tokens are limited to this organization. Sessions, trusted devices, and push-notification registrations belong to the person’s account, so the sign-out also reaches their other organizations and any individual plan.

The request doesn’t delete anything that is already stored on a device.

#### What the request doesn’t end

The request doesn’t end any of the following:

* **API keys:** They keep working, including Admin API keys that the person created. To stop an Admin API key, delete it in the **Keys** section of [claude.ai > Organization settings > API](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/api-access).
* **OAuth tokens for other organizations:** To end them, send the request in each organization with that organization’s key. The person has the same `id` in every organization. OAuth tokens issued to the person’s account and not to an organization also keep working, and this request can’t end them.
* **Claude Code cloud sessions and routines:** Sessions that run on Anthropic’s infrastructure, such as Claude Code on the web, or in one of your [self-hosted environments](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/self-hosted-environments) keep running. Work in progress when you send the request, or started soon after, can fail. The session then gets new credentials without the person signing in again, and continues. The person’s [routines](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/routines) that run on a schedule or on GitHub events keep starting new sessions. The **Sign out everywhere** action leaves these running too.
* **Computers linked to Cowork:** They stay linked.
* **A sign-in that is in progress:** One that’s already under way can finish during the request, or up to 5 minutes after it. If the [audit log export](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/compliance-api?sdk_languages=cli#export-audit-logs) or [Activity Feed](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/compliance-activity-feed?sdk_languages=cli) shows the person signing in after the request, send it again. Sign-ins to apps such as Claude Code aren’t recorded there, so if the person was signing in to one, send it again after 5 minutes.

#### Who you can’t sign out

The request can’t sign out the organization’s primary owner: it returns 400 with the error code `cannot_sign_out_primary_owner`. No one in your organization can sign out the primary owner, on the Members page either. The primary owner signs out their own sessions from their account settings in claude.ai.

A key with the `write:members` scope can sign out everyone else. That includes owners, members whose custom roles include the permission to manage owners, and members with the `membership_admin` role. Owners and the primary owner can do the same with the **Sign out everywhere** action on the Members page. Only the member’s role in this organization counts, so you can sign out someone who is the primary owner of a different organization.

The key keeps working after the person who created it changes role or leaves the organization. See [What happens to an Admin API key when the person who created it leaves?](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#what-happens-to-an-admin-api-key-when-the-person-who-created-it-leaves).

Error responses follow the standard shape documented in [Claude API errors](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/errors?sdk_languages=cli), with the error code in `error.details.error_code`:

```json

  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "message": "...",
    "details": {
      "error_code": "cannot_sign_out_primary_owner"

#### Where the sign-out is recorded

Each sign-out that completes is recorded as `org_user_trusted_devices_revoked`, the same event that the **Sign out everywhere** action records. It appears in the [audit log export](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/compliance-api?sdk_languages=cli#export-audit-logs) that owners download in claude.ai. If your organization has the Compliance API, it also appears in the [Activity Feed](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/compliance-activity-feed?sdk_languages=cli), with counts of the trusted devices and sessions that the request ended. A request that stops partway appears in the Activity Feed too, with `completed` set to `false`, and not in the audit log.

## Invites

### Create an invite

`POST /v1/organizations/invites` sends an invitation email and returns the invite with a server-assigned `expires_at`. `role` must be `user` or `managed`. If a pending invite already exists for the email address, or the address already belongs to a member, the request returns 400 naming the existing resource. Organizations whose identity provider provisions users automatically (JIT or SCIM) cannot create invites through the API. Requires the `write:members` scope, plus `write:rbac_groups` when `role` is `managed`.

On plans that draw members from a finite seat pool, the invite automatically takes a seat from the lowest tier that has availability. The API does not take a tier parameter. If no seat is free, the request fails with a 400 error rather than purchasing a seat. Add seats through the organization’s plan management and retry.

The optional `rbac_group_ids` field lists groups (by `rbac_group_`-prefixed ID) to assign to the member when they accept. Passing a non-empty `rbac_group_ids` additionally requires the key to carry the `write:rbac_groups` scope, because group assignment can grant the permissions attached to the group’s roles.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Create invite](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/organization/invites/create?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant organization:invites create \
    --email newhire@example.com \
    --role managed \
    --rbac-group-id rbac_group_01UvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMn
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "type": "invite",
  "id": "invite_01QrStUvWxYzAbCdEfGhIj",
  "email": "newhire@example.com",
  "role": "managed",
  "invited_at": "2026-07-06T16:20:11Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-07-27T16:20:11Z",
  "accepted_at": null,
  "status": "pending",
  "rbac_group_ids": ["rbac_group_01UvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMn"]
}
```

### List invites

`GET /v1/organizations/invites` returns the organization’s invites, most recent first, across the `pending`, `accepted`, and `expired` states. To list only invites in certain states, pass `statuses[]` once for each state, for example `statuses[]=pending`. Requires the `read:members` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [List invites](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/organization/invites/list?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant organization:invites list --limit 20
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Get an invite

`GET /v1/organizations/invites/{invite_id}` returns one invite by ID. Requires the `read:members` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Get invite](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/organization/invites/retrieve?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant organization:invites retrieve --invite-id invite_01QrStUvWxYzAbCdEfGhIj
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Withdraw an invite

`DELETE /v1/organizations/invites/{invite_id}` withdraws a `pending` invite, deactivating the link in the invitation email. Withdrawing an `accepted` invite returns 400 (remove the member instead); withdrawing an `expired` invite returns 400. Requires the `write:members` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Delete invite](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/organization/invites/delete?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant organization:invites delete --invite-id invite_01QrStUvWxYzAbCdEfGhIj
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Groups

Groups your enterprise creates directly, in [claude.ai organization settings](https://claude.ai/admin-settings) or through this API (`source_type: "direct"`), support every endpoint in this section. Groups provisioned by your identity provider (`source_type: "scim"`) can be read but not modified: renaming or deleting a SCIM group, or changing its membership, returns 400, because your identity provider owns it.

### List groups

`GET /v1/organizations/rbac_groups` returns your enterprise’s groups, including identity-provider-managed (`scim`) groups. Requires the `read:rbac_groups` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [List groups](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/organization/rbac_groups/list?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant beta:organization:rbac-groups list --limit 20

### Get a group

`GET /v1/organizations/rbac_groups/{rbac_group_id}` returns one group by ID. Requires the `read:rbac_groups` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Get group](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/organization/rbac_groups/retrieve?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant beta:organization:rbac-groups retrieve \
    --rbac-group-id rbac_group_01UvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMn
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Create a group

`POST /v1/organizations/rbac_groups` creates a group with the given `name` (1–255 characters) and no roles or members. Requires the `write:rbac_groups` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Create group](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/organization/rbac_groups/create?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant beta:organization:rbac-groups create --name Engineering
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "type": "rbac_group",
  "id": "rbac_group_01UvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMn",
  "name": "Engineering",
  "source_type": "direct",
  "role_ids": [],
  "created_at": "2026-07-09T18:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-07-09T18:00:00Z"
}
```

### Rename a group

`POST /v1/organizations/rbac_groups/{rbac_group_id}` updates the group. `name` is the only field this endpoint can change. Requires the `write:rbac_groups` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Update group](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/organization/rbac_groups/update?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant beta:organization:rbac-groups update \
    --rbac-group-id rbac_group_01UvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMn \
    --name "Platform Engineering"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Delete a group

`DELETE /v1/organizations/rbac_groups/{rbac_group_id}` deletes the group. Its members remain members of their organizations, but they lose the permissions of its attached roles, and a group [spend limit](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/spend-limits-api?sdk_languages=cli), if one existed, stops applying to them. Requires the `write:rbac_groups` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Delete group](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/organization/rbac_groups/delete?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant beta:organization:rbac-groups delete \
    --rbac-group-id rbac_group_01UvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMn
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "id": "rbac_group_01UvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMn",
  "type": "rbac_group_deleted"
}
```

### List a group’s members

`GET /v1/organizations/rbac_groups/{rbac_group_id}/members` returns the group’s members (each with their `user_id` and email), oldest first. Only current members of your enterprise’s organizations are returned, so a page might contain fewer than `limit` entries while `has_more` is `true`. Requires the `read:rbac_groups` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [List group members](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/organization/rbac_groups/members/list?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant beta:organization:rbac-groups:members list \
    --rbac-group-id rbac_group_01UvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMn \
    --limit 100
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "rbac_group_member",
      "rbac_group_id": "rbac_group_01UvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMn",
      "user_id": "user_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "created_at": "2026-04-07T12:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "has_more": false,
  "next_page": null
}
```

### Add a member to a group

`POST /v1/organizations/rbac_groups/{rbac_group_id}/members` adds an organization member to the group by `user_id`. The user must already be a member of one of your enterprise’s organizations (the request returns 404 otherwise), and adding someone who is already in the group returns 400. For `scim` groups, membership is managed in your identity provider and this request returns 400. To assign groups to a person who has not joined yet, use `rbac_group_ids` on [invite creation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#create-an-invite) instead. Requires the `write:rbac_groups` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Add group member](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/organization/rbac_groups/members/add?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant beta:organization:rbac-groups:members add \
    --rbac-group-id rbac_group_01UvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMn \
    --user-id user_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "type": "rbac_group_member",
  "rbac_group_id": "rbac_group_01UvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMn",
  "user_id": "user_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "created_at": "2026-07-09T18:00:00Z"
}
```

### Remove a member from a group

`DELETE /v1/organizations/rbac_groups/{rbac_group_id}/members/{user_id}` removes the member from the group; they remain a member of their organization. The request returns 404 if the user is not a member of the group, and 400 for `scim` groups, whose membership is managed in your identity provider. Requires the `write:rbac_groups` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Remove group member](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/organization/rbac_groups/members/remove?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant beta:organization:rbac-groups:members remove \
    --rbac-group-id rbac_group_01UvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMn \
    --user-id user_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "rbac_group_id": "rbac_group_01UvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMn",
  "user_id": "user_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt",
  "type": "rbac_group_member_deleted"
}
```

## Custom roles

Custom roles are read-only through the API: these endpoints catalog your organization’s custom roles (defined in [claude.ai organization settings](https://claude.ai/admin-settings) or provisioned by Anthropic) and the permissions each role grants. Custom-role reads use the `read:members` scope (there is no separate role scope) and work with an organization-level key, and the catalog returned is your organization’s own.

Read a role’s name from its `display_name` field. For a role provisioned by Anthropic, `display_name` can differ from the label claude.ai shows, and Anthropic might change the name. To keep a lasting reference to a role, store its `id`.

### List roles

`GET /v1/organizations/rbac_roles` returns your organization’s custom roles. Requires the `read:members` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [List roles](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/organization/rbac_roles/list?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant beta:organization:rbac-roles list --limit 20
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "rbac_role",
      "id": "rbac_role_01CdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
      "display_name": "Engineering base",
      "created_at": "2026-03-18T10:01:42Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-05-02T08:55:09Z"
    }
  ],
  "has_more": false,
  "next_page": null
}
```

### Get a role

`GET /v1/organizations/rbac_roles/{rbac_role_id}` returns one role by ID. Requires the `read:members` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Get role](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/organization/rbac_roles/retrieve?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant beta:organization:rbac-roles retrieve \
    --rbac-role-id rbac_role_01CdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### List a role’s permissions

`GET /v1/organizations/rbac_roles/{rbac_role_id}/permissions` returns the role’s permissions. Each permission pairs a `resource` (what it applies to: the organization’s product features, a connector tool, a connector OAuth scope, one connector, or every connector) with an `action` (what it grants on that resource). Rows for features not enabled for your organization are omitted, so a page might contain fewer than `limit` rows while `has_more` is `true`. Requires the `read:members` scope.

Two `action` values need special care. An `organization` permission whose action is `capability_access_all` (every product feature) or `capability_access_all_ga` (every stable product feature, that is, every feature not labeled beta or research preview) is a blanket grant. It is listed as that single row rather than expanded. A blanket grant covers neither model access nor the `permission_`-prefixed admin-panel permissions, nor `inference_hooks_inspection`, which a role holds only through a row that names it. When you tally what a role grants, treat a blanket row as covering everything its variant describes, not just the features named in other rows.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [List role permissions](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/beta/organization/rbac_roles/permissions/list?sdk_languages=cli) in the API reference.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  ant beta:organization:rbac-roles:permissions list \
    --rbac-role-id rbac_role_01CdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv \
    --limit 20
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "rbac_role_permission",
      "resource": {
        "type": "organization",
        "organization_id": "12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678"
      },
      "action": "capability_access_all_ga"
    },
    {

      "resource": {
        "type": "connector_tool",
        "connector_id": "mcpsrv_01WxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMnOp",
        "tool_name": "search_tickets"
      },
      "action": "use"
    }
  ],
  "has_more": false,

}
```

## Example workflows

### Offboard a departing employee

1. Look up the member by email:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash CLI
     ant organization:users list --email departing@example.com
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

2. Remove them with `DELETE /v1/organizations/users/{user_id}`, using the `id` from the response. Their seat, if any, returns to the pool.

3. If the person had not yet joined, the lookup returns no member; list invites and withdraw their `pending` invite instead.

### Respond to a lost or stolen device

Before you need this workflow, create a key with the `write:members` and `read:members` scopes for the [sign-out endpoint](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#sign-a-member-out-everywhere). If you have no key yet, an owner can use the **Sign out everywhere** action on the Members page of [claude.ai organization settings](https://claude.ai/admin-settings) in place of steps 2 to 4. An owner can’t use it on their own account: they sign out their own sessions from their account settings in claude.ai.

1. First, sign the person out of your identity provider, or disable their account there. Otherwise, whoever holds the lost device can sign in to Claude again through that device’s identity provider session or the person’s mailbox.

2. Look up the member by email address, as in step 1 of [Offboard a departing employee](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#offboard-a-departing-employee). The email match tolerates variants of the same address, so check that the response is the right person.

3. Sign them out with `POST /v1/organizations/users/{user_id}/sign_out`, using the `id` from the response. [Sign a member out everywhere](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#sign-a-member-out-everywhere) lists the headers that the request needs and what it ends.

4. If the request returns 503, send it again until it returns 200. If it returns 400 with `cannot_sign_out_primary_owner`, see [Who you can’t sign out](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#who-you-cant-sign-out).

5. Check the [audit log export](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/compliance-api?sdk_languages=cli#export-audit-logs) or [Activity Feed](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/compliance-activity-feed?sdk_languages=cli) for a sign-in after the first request. If you find one, or the person was signing in to an app such as Claude Code, send the request again after 5 minutes. If you can’t send the request, use the **Sign out everywhere** action again instead. This also signs the member out of any session that they have started since, so tell them first.

6. Confirm the sign-out [where it is recorded](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#where-the-sign-out-is-recorded), and review [what the request doesn’t end](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#what-the-request-doesnt-end).

### Audit group membership

1. List groups and record each group’s `id`, `name`, and `role_ids`.

2. For each group that carries sensitive roles, page through `GET /v1/organizations/rbac_groups/{rbac_group_id}/members` and compare the member emails against your identity provider’s roster.

3. Remove members who should no longer be in the group with `DELETE /v1/organizations/rbac_groups/{rbac_group_id}/members/{user_id}`. For `scim` groups, make the change in your identity provider instead.

For a workflow that combines group membership with a temporary spend limit raise, see [Temporarily raise a member’s spend limit during an incident](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/spend-limits-api?sdk_languages=cli#temporarily-raise-a-members-spend-limit-during-an-incident) on the Spend Limits API page.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is this a different API from the Admin API?

No. The member and invite endpoints are the same `/v1/organizations/` endpoints that Claude Console organizations use; this page documents their Claude Enterprise behavior. The group and custom-role endpoints are part of the same API and exist only for Claude Enterprise organizations. The [availability table](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#which-endpoints-can-your-organization-use) shows which endpoints each organization type can call.

### Can the API assign the owner or membership admin role?

No. The API assigns only `user` and `managed`, on invite creation and role updates. Administrative roles are assigned in claude.ai organization settings, and members holding them cannot be modified or removed through the API.

### Can the API create or modify groups?

Yes, with the `write:rbac_groups` scope: create, rename, and delete groups, and add or remove their members. Two things the API cannot change: groups provisioned by your identity provider (`source_type: "scim"`), whose name and membership are owned by the identity provider, and [custom roles](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#custom-roles), which are managed in claude.ai organization settings (the API reads them).

### Does an unaccepted invite consume a seat?

On plans with a finite seat pool, yes: a `pending` invite holds a seat. Withdrawing the invite or letting it expire frees the seat. On plans without a seat pool, invites consume nothing.

### Which operations work when your organization uses single sign-on?

If your identity provider provisions users automatically (JIT or SCIM), invite creation returns 400. If it manages roles (advanced SSO or advanced SCIM provisioning), role updates return 400. If it manages membership (SCIM provisioning), member removals return 400. Reads work regardless. So does [signing a member out everywhere](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#sign-a-member-out-everywhere), whichever single sign-on mode your organization uses.

### Does signing a member out keep them out?

No. [Signing a member out](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#sign-a-member-out-everywhere) ends their sign-in sessions, trusted devices, and OAuth tokens for your organization, but they can sign in again right away. To keep someone out, [remove them](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/user-management?sdk_languages=cli#remove-a-member) or, if your organization requires single sign-on, disable their account in your identity provider. Disabling the account alone might not end sessions that are already open, so first sign the person out of your identity provider, then sign them out of Claude, and then remove them or disable their account.

### What happens to an Admin API key when the person who created it leaves?

The key keeps working. Admin API keys are scoped to the organization, not to individual users, and a key created in claude.ai does not expire. Removing the creator from the organization or deprovisioning them through your identity provider ends their own access, but not the keys they created. Downgrading their role does not change the keys either: each key stays active with its original scopes. When you offboard someone who created Admin API keys, delete those keys in the **Keys** section of [claude.ai > Organization settings > API](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/api-access) and create replacements.
