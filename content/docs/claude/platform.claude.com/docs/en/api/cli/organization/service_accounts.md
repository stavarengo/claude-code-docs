# Service Accounts

## Create Service Account

`$ ant organization:service-accounts create`

**POST** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts`

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-admin-api?sdk_languages=cli).

Create a service account.

A service account is a named workload identity that federation rules
target. `organization_role` is `developer` (default) or `admin`; a rule
may only be created or retargeted to grant `org:admin` scope when the
target's `organization_role` is `admin`. Creating an `admin`-role service
account requires an interactive credential (a user OAuth token or a
Console session) — a workload may only create `developer`-role service
accounts.

### Parameters

- `--name: string`

  Slug identifier (lowercase, digits, hyphens). Unique within the organization; a duplicate name returns 409.

  minLength: 1, maxLength: 255

- `--description: optional string`

  Optional free-text description.

  maxLength: 2000

- `--organization-role: optional "admin" or "developer"`

  Org-level role. Defaults to `developer`.

### Returns

- `service_account: object`

  Named non-human identity within the caller's organization.

  A service account is a pure identity: name + org. Authorization lives on
  whatever references it (federation rules).

  - `type: "service_account"`

  - `id: string`

    Tagged ID of the service account.

  - `archived_at: string`

    If set, this service account is archived.

    format: date-time

  - `archived_by_actor_id: string`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that archived this service account.

  - `created_at: string`

    When this service account was created.

    format: date-time

  - `created_by_actor_id: string`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that created this service account.

  - `description: string`

    Optional free-text description.

  - `name: string`

    Admin-chosen slug identifier.

  - `organization_role: "admin" or "developer"`

    Org-level role. A federation rule may only be created or retargeted to grant `org:admin` scope when this is `admin`. A rule granting `org:admin` whose target is later demoted to `developer` is rejected at token exchange. Rules granting `org:admin` are managed in the Console.

    - `"admin"`

    - `"developer"`

  - `updated_at: string`

    When this service account was last updated.

    format: date-time

  - `updated_by_actor_id: string`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that last updated this service account.

Add a service account to a workspace with the given `workspace_role`.

Mirror of `POST /workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts`, addressed
from the service-account side; both create the same membership. If the
service account is already an explicit member of the workspace, its
`workspace_role` is replaced with the value supplied here. Archived
workspaces return 400. Archived service accounts cannot be added and are
rejected.

#### Parameters

- `--service-account-id: string` (path parameter)

  ID of the service account.

- `--workspace-id: string`

  Tagged workspace ID to add the service account to.

  Role to assign to the service account in this workspace.

#### Returns

- `service_account_workspace_member: object`

  - `workspace_id: string`

    Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`).

  - `workspace_role: "workspace_admin" or "workspace_billing" or "workspace_developer" or 2 more`

    - `"workspace_restricted_developer"`

    - `"workspace_user"`

#### Example

```bash
ant organization:service-accounts:workspaces add \

  --service-account-id service_account_id \
  --workspace-id workspace_id \
  --workspace-role workspace_admin
```

##### Response (200)

  "created_by_actor_id": "created_by_actor_id",
  "implicit": true,

### List Workspaces For Service Account

`$ ant organization:service-accounts:workspaces list`

**GET** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces`

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-admin-api?sdk_languages=cli).

List the workspaces a service account is a member of.

Each entry includes the service account's `workspace_role` in that
workspace. Use `limit` and the `next_page` cursor to paginate. When the
service account has no explicit default-workspace membership, the
implicit (`implicit: true`) membership is returned as the first entry on
the first page; with `limit=1` the first page may return up to 2 entries
(the implicit entry plus one explicit membership) so a pagination cursor
can be derived. Memberships are returned only while
the service account is active. Without a `page` cursor, an archived
service account returns an empty list. A `page` cursor that does not
match an active membership returns a 400 invalid-request error. A cursor
stops matching when the membership is removed, the workspace is deleted,
or the service account is archived. Restart pagination from the first
page to recover.

#### Parameters

- `--service-account-id: string` (path parameter)

  ID of the service account.

- `--limit: optional number` (query parameter)

  Number of results per page.

  minimum: 1, maximum: 100

- `--page: optional string` (query parameter)

  Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page`.

#### Returns

- `ServiceAccountWorkspaceMemberListResponse: object`

  - `data: array of ServiceAccountWorkspaceMember`

    - `type: "service_account_workspace_member"`

    - `created_by_actor_id: string`

      Tagged ID (`user_...`/`svac_...`) of the actor who created this membership.

    - `implicit: boolean`

      True when this is the implicit default-workspace membership every service account has when no explicit membership exists. Implicit memberships have role `workspace_user` and cannot be removed.

    - `service_account_id: string`

      Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`).

    - `workspace_id: string`

      Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`).

    - `workspace_role: "workspace_admin" or "workspace_billing" or "workspace_developer" or 2 more`

      Role of the service account in this workspace. Service accounts cannot hold the `workspace_billing` role.

      - `"workspace_admin"`

      - `"workspace_billing"`

      - `"workspace_developer"`

      - `"workspace_restricted_developer"`

      - `"workspace_user"`

  - `next_page: string`

    Opaque cursor for the next page, or null if no more results.

#### Example

```bash
ant organization:service-accounts:workspaces list \
  --api-key my-anthropic-api-key \
  --service-account-id service_account_id
```

##### Response (200)

```json

### Remove Workspace From Service Account

`$ ant organization:service-accounts:workspaces remove`

**DELETE** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces/{workspace_id}`

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-admin-api?sdk_languages=cli).

Mirror of `DELETE /workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts/{service_account_id}`,
addressed from the service-account side. Removal is idempotent (returns
200 even if the membership was already removed). A DELETE against the
implicit default-workspace membership returns 200 but is a no-op and the
membership persists; deleting an explicit default-workspace row reverts
to the implicit `workspace_user` membership. Archived workspaces return
400.

#### Parameters

- `--service-account-id: string` (path parameter)

  ID of the service account.

- `--workspace-id: string` (path parameter)

  ID of the workspace.

#### Returns

- `OrganizationServiceAccountWorkspaceRemoveResponse: object`

  - `type: "service_account_workspace_member_deleted"`

  - `service_account_id: string`

    Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`) named in the delete request. Removal is idempotent; see the endpoint description for the implicit-membership no-op.

  - `workspace_id: string`

    Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`) named in the delete request.

#### Example

```bash
ant organization:service-accounts:workspaces remove \
  --api-key my-anthropic-api-key \
  --service-account-id service_account_id \
  --workspace-id workspace_id
```

##### Response (200)

```json
{
  "service_account_id": "service_account_id",
  "type": "service_account_workspace_member_deleted",
  "workspace_id": "workspace_id"
}
```
