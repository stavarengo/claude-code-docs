Model ID: `gpt-6.1-sol`

GPT-6.1 Sol delivers near-Astra performance at a lower cost for complex coding,
computer use, and professional work. Compare it with Astra on your tasks to
assess the tradeoff between quality and cost.

`reasoning.effort` supports `low`, `medium` (default), `high`, `xhigh`, and
`max`. The `none` and `minimal` reasoning efforts are not supported.

Use the Responses API for tool calling. Chat Completions is supported without
tool calling.

For the fastest response speeds, use [Ultrafast mode](/api/docs/guides/ultrafast-mode)
with `model: "gpt-6.1-sol"` and `service_tier: "ultrafast"` in the Responses API.

GPT-6.1 Sol supports US and EU data residency, including with Fast and Ultrafast
modes. See [data residency eligibility](/api/docs/guides/your-data#which-models-and-features-are-eligible-for-data-residency).

See [GPT-6.1 Sol in the GPT-6 guide](/api/docs/guides/latest-model?model=gpt-6-astra#gpt-61-sol) and
[model-selection guidance](/api/docs/guides/model-selection#when-to-consider-gpt-61-sol).

- Output modalities: text
- Unsupported modalities: audio, video
- 1,050,000 context window
- Maximum input tokens: 922,000
- 128,000 max output tokens

## Pricing

Pricing is based on the number of tokens used, or other metrics based on the model type. For tool-specific models, like search and computer use, there’s a fee per tool call. See details in the [pricing page](/api/docs/pricing).

### Text tokens

| Metric | Price | Unit |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Input | $2 | 1M tokens |
| Cached input | $0.1 | 1M tokens |
| Cache writes | $2.5 | 1M tokens |
| Output | $10 | 1M tokens |

- Cached input tokens are priced at 5% of the uncached input token rate.
- Cache writes are billed at 1.25x the uncached input token rate.
- Prompts with more than 272K input tokens are priced at 2x input and cache rates and 1.5x output for the full request.
- Fast mode prices are 2x Standard. Batch and Flex prices are 50% lower than Standard.
- Ultrafast mode prices are 6x Standard.
- Regional processing adds a 10% premium where available.

## Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests, tokens, audio duration, or other usage within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.

### Standard

| Tier | RPM | TPM |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Build | 5,000 | 1,000,000 |
| Launch | 10,000 | 4,000,000 |
| Grow | 15,000 | 40,000,000 |
